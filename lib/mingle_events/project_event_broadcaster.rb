Unable to complete event processing for processor #{processor}. 
There will be no re-try for one or more of the events below.
Also, some of the events below may have actually been processed.
In order to have a more accurate understanding of which events
were processed and which were not processed you will need to add
more precise error handling to your processor. If you are writing
a publisher/notifier (and not a filter) you should consider writing
a subclass of AbstractNoRetryProcessor in order to narrow the scope
of processing failure to single events.
