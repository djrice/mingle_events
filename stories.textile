h2. Urgent

* Make this a gem and publish to rubygems.org

h2. High

* Simplify some of the test XML now that entry parsing is lazy

* Need processors:
** Author filter
** Property definition filter
** Property value filter
** Card number filter 
** Http POST publisher w/ basic and digest auth support

* Enhance CardData with more data beyond card type

* Proper logging

h2. Medium

* Implement schedule polling. Currently there is only a 'run_once' and polling at regular intervals can only be accomplished via cron and similar.

* Need processors:
** Email publisher
** Jabber publisher

* What about Retry?  Do something a bit more 'real' with dead letter office.

* When a filter (or anything that is not a subclass of AbstractNoRetryProcessor) blows up, I'm not convinced the correct error handling is in place.
