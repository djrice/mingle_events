h2. Urgent

* there's likely a bug around seeing new events against a real instance of mingle given that the 'last page' will be remembered as the un-parameterized version of the event feed.

* Document :from_now v. :from_beginning_of_time
* Restore optimizations (bulk data loading & bulk event processing) when simply getting latest events
* Should MingleFeedCache utilize the new ability of Page to determine if it's archived?

h2. High

* Simplify some of the test XML now that entry parsing is lazy

* Need processors:
** Author filter
** Property definition filter
** Property value filter
** Card number filter 
** Http POST publisher w/ basic and digest auth support
** Jabber publisher

* Enhance CardData with more data beyond card type

* Proper logging

* Make it easier to manage gem publication

h2. Medium

* More robust error handling; provide options
