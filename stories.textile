h2. Urgent

* there's likely a bug around seeing new events against a real instance of mingle given that the 'last page' will be remembered as the un-parameterized version of the event feed.

* Restore optimizations (bulk data loading & bulk event processing) when simply getting latest events
* Restore ability to only poll for events starting from "now" when polling a project with a lot of history, i.e., avoid processing the thousands of events before "now"

h2. Medium

* More robust error handling?? What would be appropriate??
